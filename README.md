# Livestock Monitoring System

## Overview

The *Livestock Monitoring System* is a technology-driven solution designed to enhance the management and well-being of livestock. It helps farmers track livestock movements, monitor their health, and detect obstacles in their environment using various sensors and automation tools.

The *Livestock Monitoring System* is designed to track and manage livestock using *Raspberry Pi 3B, BrickPi, LEGO Mindstorms motors, ultrasonic sensors, and a web camera*. This system helps detect obstacles, automate movement, and monitor livestock remotely.

## Hardware Components

| Component                   | Function                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Raspberry Pi 3B (1GB RAM)* | Controls the entire system                              |
| *BrickPi*                   | Interfaces Raspberry Pi with LEGO Mindstorms components |
| *Web Camera*                | Captures live video feed                                |
| *2 Ultrasonic Sensors*      | Detects obstacles (front and back)                      |
| *2 LEGO Mindstorms Motors*  | Controls movement (gates, feeding systems)              |

## Features
